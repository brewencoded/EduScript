# EduScript

Intermediate educational JavaScript projects.

## About

This library was built for two reasons.
* I wanted to use this project to display JavaScript Design Patterns for educational use
* I wanted to show some general best practices for developing JavaScript modules

This repository is a grouping of projects that can be used to learn JavaScript conventions, tooling, and design patterns. Each step will build on the last showing different design patterns and development tools. Every consecutive step will aim to add an improvement to either the workflow or the debugging process. I will show why I made certain decisions and explain the process I used to make those decisions. If I made errors along the way, I'll provide explanations and solutions. The best part of this project, is that it isn't just another Todo app. This is a more realistic project, giving a better idea of how to implement the abstract concepts we all learn as JavaScript developers. 

The goal is to use get the same resulting project using varying developement techniques. An outsider can read view the readme for details information and look at the source code to get an understanding of the development strategy and apply its principles.
